# Webbit

A _nearly_ full-feature Reddit clone wbuit with Ruby on Rails.
The app is the result of the Hello Rails course.

## Modeling

Each model will be responsible for different data throughout the app.

- User - focused on the user.
- Submission - The user authors this. Has different media (text, image/video, link)
- Community - Category based on submissions
- Comments - A response given to the submission from another user to a given user.
- Subscription - Not to be confused with billing. A user can be subscribed and unsubscribe to a community.
